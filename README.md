You need the real time clock library and SdFat library.
* RTClib: https://github.com/mizraith/RTClib
* SdFat: https://github.com/greiman/SdFat

Download the ZIP files from each of those pages. 

Extract the RTClib_master.zip file, rename the folder inside from RTClib-master to RTClib.
Place the folder RTClib inside your Arduino/libraries/ directory.

Extract the SdFat-master.zip file, open the SdFat-master folder. Inside find the SdFat folder,
copy that to your Arduino/libraries directory. 

Restart the Arduino program so that both new libraries can be found by the software.
